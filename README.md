# DL Architectures Implementations
[![techused](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,pytorch)](https://skillicons.dev)
This repository contains my implementations using `Pytorch` of the DNN architectures that were introduced in the Deep Learning Course at Roma Tre University. Below is illustrated the structure of this project:

- `docs`: pictures that shows the architecture of the implemented models
- `models`: architectures implementation with pytorch
- `train`: various script used for training, the only task shown is classification
