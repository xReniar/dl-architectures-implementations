# DL Architectures Implementations
This repository contains my implementations using `Pytorch` of the DNN architectures that were introduced in the Deep Learning Course at Roma Tre University. Below is illustrated the structure of this project:
```txt
.
├── docs
│   └── architectures
├── models
│   ├── AlexNet
│   └── ...
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── utils
    ├── data_loader.py
    ├── datasets.py
    └── train.py 
```
- `docs`: pictures that shows the architecture of the implemented models
- `models`: architectures implementation with pytorch
- `utils`: various script for data loading or dataset processing
