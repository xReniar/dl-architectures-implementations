This repository contains my implementations using `Pytorch` of the DNN architectures that were introduced in the Deep Learning Course at Roma Tre University. Below is illustrated the structure of this project:
```txt

- `docs`: pictures that shows the architecture of the implemented models
- `models`: architectures implementation with pytorch
- `train`: various script used for training, the only task shown is classification
